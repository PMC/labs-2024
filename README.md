# Labs 2024

This repository contains weekly mini projects (labs) developed as part of a course in learning C#. It includes various modules designed to solve and learning specific concepts in software development.

## Sub Labs per week

## Week 48: MiniProject

This program, implemented in C#, allows users to manage a list of products interactively through a console application. The application provides functionality to add products with attributes like category, name, and price, as well as options to search for products, view the entire product list sorted by price, and calculate the total cost of all products.

## Week 49: AssetTracker

AssetTracker is a .NET console application designed to manage and track assets in various office locations. The program fetches live currency conversion rates from an online API to accurately convert asset values from EURO into the desired currencies. This is particularly useful for companies managing assets in multiple currencies and office locations.

### Features

1. **Office Location Management**:
   - Tracks and organizes assets by their assigned office location.
   - Supports displaying detailed asset information.

2. **Real-Time Currency Conversion**:
   - The program makes an API call to retrieve current currency conversion rates.
   - Conversion rates are utilized to calculate asset values in the desired office target currency.

3. **Displaying Assets**:
   - Displays a list of all tracked assets grouped by office location and expiry date.
   - Shows original **EURO** and converted values for each asset.
